Date & Time:  2025-10-25 14:06:08
Location: [Insert Location]
Attendees: [Speaker 1] [Speaker 2]
1. Homepage UI adjustments and interactivity
The homepage requires multiple changes: enlarge the logo in the top left; remove business hours from the top right; ensure consistent wording for 24-7 service support wording; the metrics (clients served, clients rating, years of experience, success rate) appear clickable but have no destination, so either remove clickability or link them to relevant sections/pages; in the "Why choose MRECAI" section, update the title to "Why choose MRECAI" and make each button (expert team, fast results, innovative solutions, personalized service, proven track record, trusted partner) clickable and link to relevant content; services buttons should be visually adjusted (e.g., blue) and have additional bullet points for each service to improve clarity and prominence.
Action Items 
-  Increase the logo size on the homepage top-left to improve visibility. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Remove business hours from the homepage top-right. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Standardize wording for support availability to consistently state "24-7 service support available" across the homepage. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Resolve metrics clickability: either disable clicks or link each metric (clients served, clients rating, years of experience, success rate) to appropriate sections on the homepage or other pages. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Rename the section to "Why choose MRECAI" and make each button (expert team, fast results, innovative solutions, personalized service, proven track record, trusted partner) clickable, leading to relevant pages or sections. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Restyle services buttons (make them blue) and add a few more bullet points for each service. -- 2025-10-25 
2. Intake form page and Google Forms integration
A new intake form page must be added and integrated, containing links to all Google Forms for insurance and new client intake documents so visitors can fill and submit directly for a quote.
Action Items 
-  Create an Intake Form page that embeds or links all Google Forms for insurance and new client intake; ensure submissions route appropriately for quote processing. -- 2025-10-25 
3. Chatbot troubleshooting and fix
The website chatbot is non-responsive and fails to assist with user tasks. It needs investigation and repair to function correctly.
Action Items 
-  Diagnose and fix the chatbot so it responds and assists users as intended; validate scenarios and error handling. -- 2025-10-25 
4. About Us restructuring and content updates
Revise the Our Journey section on the About Us page and restructure About Us into three sub-pages: About the Company (who we are, mission, operations), Who I Am (founder and president), and Strategic Partners (insurance carrier, financial advisor, accountant, and others). The business journey started in 2024 and grew; this should be reflected in content.
Action Items 
-  Revise "Our Journey" content to reflect that the business started in 2024 and grew, ensuring accuracy and coherence. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Create three sub-pages under About Us: 1) About the Company (who we are, mission, operations), 2) Who I Am (founder and president), 3) Strategic Partners (list: insurance carrier, financial advisor, accountant, and others). -- 2025-10-25 
5. Contact integrations: Google Business, Yelp, social media, and Calendly
Connect the Contact Us page with the Google Business page, Yelp page, and all social media websites and links. Integrate Calendly for direct consultations booking with the founder's schedule.
Action Items 
Add and verify links to Google Business, Yelp, and all social media profiles on the Contact Us page. -- 2025-10-25 
-  Integrate Calendly on the Contact Us page (or site-wide) to allow direct consultation bookings with the founder’s schedule. -- 2025-10-25 
6. Brand naming consistency
Ensure consistent usage of the brand name. It should always be called MRECAICAI (short) or MRECAI consulting and insurance (long). The "Why choose" section title must reflect "Why choose MRECAICAI."
Action Items 
-  Audit and update site content to consistently use "MRECAICAI" (short) and "MRECAI consulting and insurance" (long) across pages and sections, including the "Why choose" section. -- 2025-10-25 
7. Content development after structure completion
Content for each page and section will be developed after the site structure is completed. Structure tasks are prioritized first, with content to follow subsequently.
Action Items 
-  Plan a follow-up phase to create and refine content for each page/section after structural changes are implemented. -- 2025-10-25 
AI Suggestion
AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
1. Critical link destinations and copy standards remain undefined: Decide whether metric tiles and “Why choose MRECAICAI” buttons link to homepage anchors or dedicated subpages, and finalize a site-wide wording standard for “24-7 service support available.” Ambiguity here is blocking design and development work and risks inconsistent UX and copy.
2. Forms and workflow readiness are incomplete: Confirm the exact Google Forms to use, access permissions, and whether each form is embedded or linked. Define the end-to-end submission workflow (notifications, storage location, and CRM integration). Missing links, permissions, or workflow details could prevent launch or cause data loss.
3. Content ownership and timelines are not set: Define content owners for each page, the review and approval workflow, and delivery timelines. Create a complete content outline and gather all assets. Without accountable owners and deadlines, content dependencies will delay site launch even if structure is ready.
4. Chatbot platform and testing plan are undefined: Select the chatbot platform, document user intents and current failure points, and establish testing scripts with measurable success criteria. Dependencies on third-party services and lack of a test plan could stall resolution and degrade user support.
5. External profiles and booking configuration need confirmation: Verify exact URLs for Google Business, Yelp, and all social profiles; determine Calendly event types and availability windows; decide placement (Contact Us page vs. global widget) and fully test the booking flow. Incorrect or placeholder links and misconfigured Calendly settings will hinder bookings and credibility.
