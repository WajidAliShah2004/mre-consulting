transaction begins online. In today's economy, your online presence is your 
reputation.

KEY REALITIES:
• 87% of consumers read online reviews before contacting a business
• A one-star rating difference can shift revenue by 5-9%
• Firms with consistent social posting enjoy up to 70% more inquiries

  underwriting
