</section>
```

**File:** `client/src/utils/constants.ts`
**Changes:**
```typescript
export const SOCIAL_LINKS = {
  facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/share/1CeUfmRx4F/?mibextid=wwXIfr',
  linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/mre-consulting-insurance/',
  instagram: 'https://instagram.com/mrecaillc',

---

## 10. CONCLUSION

The MRECAI website has a **solid foundation** but is **missing critical content** specifically requested in the feedback document. The most significant gaps are:

1. **No dedicated AI consulting content** on homepage or services page
2. **Incorrect social media URLs** (all placeholders)
3. **Missing Yelp and TikTok links**
4. **Incomplete NovaEdge partnership details**

### **Recommendation:**
**DO NOT LAUNCH** until at least Phase 1 (Critical Content) is implemented. The AI consulting division is clearly a major focus for the client, and its absence is a critical gap.

### **Estimated Implementation Time:**
- Phase 1 (Critical): 2-3 days
- Phase 2 (High Priority): 2-3 days
- Phase 3 (Polish): 1-2 days
- **Total:** 5-8 days for complete implementation

---

**Report Generated:** October 31, 2025  
**Next Steps:** Begin Phase 1 implementation immediately
