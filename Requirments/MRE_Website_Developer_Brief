 Business, Yelp, and social media review feeds, allowing visitors to view live reviews and access
 company social profiles directly from the site.

 Testimonials & Reviews, Advice & Tips, and Book Now. It should have a sticky navigation bar, smooth
 scrolling transitions, and mobile responsiveness.
