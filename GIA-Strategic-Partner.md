Strategic Partner Spotlight: 
Grober Imbey Insurance Agency (GIA)

At MRE Consulting & Insurance, we believe that protecting your income, assets, and business requires more than just buying a policy — it demands a strategic, coordinated approach backed by seasoned experts who understand the complexities of your lifestyle, your work, and your financial goals.

That’s why we’ve proudly partnered with Grober Imbey Insurance Agency (GIA) — a trusted New York–based independent agency with over 50 years of excellence in personal, commercial, and high-net-worth insurance solutions.
 
Who GIA Is
Founded in the early 1970s, Grober Imbey Insurance Agency has spent more than five decades protecting families and businesses across New York, New Jersey, and the Tri-State region.
As a fully independent brokerage, GIA is not tied to any single carrier — instead, they represent dozens of top-rated national and specialty insurers, allowing them to design highly competitive, custom-built coverage strategies for even the most complex risk profiles.
Their reputation for personalized service, underwriting precision, and white-glove attention has made GIA one of the most respected insurance agencies in the region.
 
What They Do — And Why It Matters for MRE Clients
GIA specializes in delivering tailored insurance solutions across both personal and business lines, with a unique focus on high-value clients and specialized risks that require more than “cookie-cutter” policies.
Their areas of expertise include:
•	Private-Client & High-Value Personal Insurance — coverage for luxury homes, secondary residences, fine art, jewelry, collectibles, yachts, and exotic or classic vehicles.
•	Personal Insurance Solutions — home, auto, condo, umbrella, and flood insurance for professionals with complex asset structures or multi-state exposure.
•	Business & Commercial Insurance — general liability, workers’ compensation, business-owner packages, and professional liability (E&O, D&O, cyber, etc.) across diverse industries.
•	Custom Underwriting Placement — in partnership with premier carriers such as Chubb, AIG, Pure, Travelers, and The Hartford, ensuring every risk is properly rated, structured, and covered.
 

Why GIA Is the Ideal Strategic Partner for MRE Clients

Our partnership with GIA allows MRE Consulting & Insurance to deliver a truly end-to-end advisory experience that integrates insurance, risk management, and financial strategy under one coordinated umbrella.
Here’s what this means for you:
•	Advanced Underwriting for Complex Lives: Whether you’re a multi-state professional, own multiple properties, operate several businesses, or simply need comprehensive asset protection, GIA’s underwriting team understands the nuances that typical agencies miss — ensuring you’re accurately rated, fully covered, and not overpaying.
•	Multi-Carrier Flexibility: GIA can instantly quote across dozens of carriers, allowing MRE to identify the best-fit coverage at the most competitive rate — saving our clients both time and money.
•	High-Net-Worth Precision: For clients with significant assets or sophisticated estate planning structures (trusts, LLCs, or layered ownership), GIA has direct relationships with private-client divisions that understand high-value portfolios and unique liability exposure.
•	Expert Claims & Renewal Management: GIA’s in-house service team works closely with MRE to manage claims, renewals, and policy audits — proactively ensuring your coverage keeps pace with your life and business growth.
•	Shared Service Philosophy: Like MRE, GIA is committed to clarity, transparency, and education — empowering clients to understand their coverage rather than being “sold” one.
