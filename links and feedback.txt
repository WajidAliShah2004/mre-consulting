My Journey — From Numbers to Innovation

From the very beginning, I’ve always believed that success comes from understanding the numbers — and then daring to think beyond them. My journey started at the University at Buffalo, where I earned both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Accounting and Finance, graduating Summa Cum Laude and Magna Cum Laude. During my time there, I specialized in Accounting Systems and Internal Controls, developing an early passion for how technology could transform financial management and business decision-making.

While still in school, I competed — and won — several PwC accounting competitions, technology innovation challenges, and startup pitch competitions. My entrepreneurial projects gained national recognition and were even featured in national media, reinforcing my belief that technology and finance aren’t separate worlds — they’re two sides of the same coin.

After graduation, I refined my skills in the world of high finance and global business. I interned at Goldman Sachs, where I learned how large-scale financial systems truly operate, and later worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), where I deepened my understanding of audit, compliance, and corporate advisory. From there, I transitioned into the private sector, joining Merlin Entertainments as a Finance Manager, where I led financial operations, managed cross-functional teams, and implemented systems that drove efficiency, profitability, and growth.

But deep down, I always knew I was an entrepreneur at heart. I wanted to build something that didn’t just analyze numbers — but used them to empower people and businesses to take control of their futures.

That’s how MRE Consulting & Insurance was born — a firm that merges financial expertise, strategic consulting, and modern technology to provide clients with complete, data-driven solutions. I officially founded MRE Consulting & Insurance in 2024, and by 2025, I made the leap to pursue it full-time.

Today, I’m proud to lead a full-service firm that helps individuals and businesses navigate everything from tax planning and accounting to insurance, automation, and AI-driven consulting. What started as a vision to simplify financial decision-making has grown into a mission — to help every client achieve confidence, clarity, and control over their financial world.
